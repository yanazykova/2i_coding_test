# 2i_coding_test

Task: provide code that iterates in multiples of 7 up until 100, then in multiples of 8 up to 200, then multiples of 9 up to 300.

So the result (printed or returned) after the function|functions are called should be, for the 1st round of iterations: 
7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91 and 98.

The result of the 2nd round of iterations should be 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112, 120, 128, 136, 144, 152, 160, 168, 176, 184, 192, 200.

The result of the 3rd iteration should be: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 99, 108, 117, 126, 135, 144, 153, 162, 171, 180, 189, 198, 207, 216, 225, 234, 243, 252, 261, 270, 279, 288, 297.
